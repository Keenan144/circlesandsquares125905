This was built with expansion in mind. It is easy to add more circles and squares. An edge case would be if you add
more circles, and not squares. The circles would not layout correctly because each one has side margins of negative x. 
This can be fixed, however the understanding I have is that there will be a square for every two circles.


OPENING THE PAGE:
